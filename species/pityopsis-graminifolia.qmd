## Natural history notes

The Narrowleaf Silkgrass (Pityopsis graminifolia) is a perennial wildflower native to the southeastern United States, often found in dry, sandy soils and pine flatwoods. It produces bright yellow, daisy-like flowers in late summer and fall that attract a variety of pollinators. Its narrow, grasslike leaves are covered with silvery hairs, giving the plant a distinctive sheen and helping it conserve moisture. As a hardy, drought-tolerant species, it contributes to the resilience of fire-maintained ecosystems.
