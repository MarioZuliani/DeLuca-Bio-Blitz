## Natural history notes

The red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) primarily inhabits open woodlands and feeds on a wide variety of food, including insects, fruits, and seeds. Unlike most other woodpecker species, it is particularly skilled at catching insects in flight. Adults are strikingly patterned, with a vivid red head and a contrasting black-and-white body. In Florida, the species is uncommon and has a patchy breeding distribution.
