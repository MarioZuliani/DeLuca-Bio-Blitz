## Natural history notes

The Southern Wiregrass (Aristida beyrichiana) is a keystone grass species of the longleaf pine ecosystems in the southeastern United States. It forms dense clumps of fine, needle-like leaves that fuel and recover quickly from periodic fires. Its flowering spikes appear in late summer, releasing seeds that provide food for birds and small mammals. By carrying fire and stabilizing sandy soils, it plays an essential role in maintaining the biodiversity of pine savannas.
