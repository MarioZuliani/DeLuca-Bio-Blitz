## Natural history notes

The Lyreleaf Sage (Salvia lyrata) is a hardy perennial wildflower native to fields, roadsides, and open woodlands throughout the eastern United States. It produces spikes of pale blue to violet flowers in spring, which attract bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. Its lyre-shaped, often purple-tinged leaves form a low rosette that persists year-round. As both ornamental and beneficial to pollinators, itâ€™s a common and valuable component of native meadows and gardens.
