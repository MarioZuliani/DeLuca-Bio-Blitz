## Natural history notes

The Perennial Goobergrass (Amphicarpum muehlenbergianum) is a warm-season grass native to the sandy pinelands and moist flatwoods of the southeastern United States. It’s unique for producing two types of flowers—one above ground and one hidden underground—that both form seeds, an adaptation to variable environments. Its dense, fibrous roots help stabilize soil and support fire-adapted ecosystems. By providing cover and food for insects and small animals, it contributes to the health of pine savannas.
