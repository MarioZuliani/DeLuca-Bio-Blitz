## Natural history notes

The Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura) is a widespread scavenger found across Noth and South America, easily recognized by its red, bare head and long, two-toned wings. Unlike most birds, it relies heavily on its keen sense of smell to locate carrion, soaring low to detect the scent of decay. By feeding on dead animals, it plays a vital role in preventing the spread of disease and recycling nutrients back into ecosystems. Its graceful, teetering flight makes it one of the most efficient soaring birds in the world.
