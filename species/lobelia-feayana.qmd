## Natural history notes

The Bay Lobelia (Lobelia feayana) is a delicate wildflower native to moist flatwoods, bogs, and roadside ditches of the southeastern United States. It produces clusters of small, lavender to light blue flowers that bloom in spring and attract bees and butterflies. Its low, sprawling growth helps it thrive in seasonally wet soils and along pond edges. Though modest in size, it adds a splash of color to wetland landscapes and supports a variety of native pollinators.
