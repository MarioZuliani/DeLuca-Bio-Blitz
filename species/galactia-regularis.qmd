## Natural history notes

The eastern milkpea (Galactia regularis) is a native legume found in the southeastern United States. This vine typically has a purple flower associated with it and can be found climbing along the ground or even on other plants! This species, like other legumes, fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere into the soil through a symbiotic relationship with bacteria in the soil. As a result, this plant creates a more fertile soil.
