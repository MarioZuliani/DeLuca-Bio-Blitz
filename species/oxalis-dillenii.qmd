## Natural history notes

The Slender Yellow Woodsorrel (Oxalis dillenii) is a small, low-growing perennial (sometimes annual) herb in the wood-sorrel family (Oxalidaceae), native to eastern and central North America but now found widely in disturbed sites, lawns, gardens, and roadsides. Its bright yellow, five-petaled flowers bloom through spring and summer, often closing in the evening or on overcast days. Like other Oxalis, it exhibits ballistic seed dispersal — the seed capsules burst open and can fling seeds several feet. Its epithet dillenii honors German botanist Johann Jacob Dillenius (1684–1747).
