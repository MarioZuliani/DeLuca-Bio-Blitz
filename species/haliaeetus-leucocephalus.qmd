## Natural history notes

The Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), the national bird of the United States, once faced near extinction. Thanks to extensive conservation efforts, their populations have rebounded, and in 2007 the species was formally removed from the endangered species list. Today, Florida hosts one of the densest concentrations of bald eagle nests in the lower 48 states. Bald eagles have a broad range, occurring throughout most of Alaska and the contiguous United States. Their diet consists primarily of fish. While they are capable hunters, they often take advantage of other birds of prey, such as ospreys, or fishing mammals to steal fish.
