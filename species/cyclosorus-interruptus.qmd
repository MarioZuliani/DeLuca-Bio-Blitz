## Natural history notes

The Lilac Tasselflower (Emilia sonchifolia) is a small, weedy wildflower native to Asia but now naturalized throughout the southeastern United States. It produces slender stems topped with pink to purplish tassel-like flower heads that bloom nearly year-round in warm climates. Often found in lawns, roadsides, and disturbed soils, it provides nectar for small butterflies and bees. Though considered a weed in some areas, it adds color and pollinator value to open, sunny habitats.
