## Natural history notes

The Appressed Bog Clubmoss (Lycopodiella appressa) is a primitive, fern-like plant native to bogs, wet pine savannas, and marshes of the southeastern United States. It spreads by creeping stems that root along the ground, forming dense mats in moist, acidic soils. Its upright, cone-bearing shoots release spores rather than seeds, reflecting its ancient lineage. By stabilizing soils and contributing to bog structure, it plays a quiet but vital role in wetland ecosystems.
