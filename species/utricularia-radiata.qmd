## Natural history notes

The Small Swollen Bladderwort (Utricularia radiata) is a small, free-floating aquatic carnivorous plant native to eastern North America. The name radiata means “rayed” or “radiating,” referring to the whorl of inflated float structures. It was once considered a variety of Utricularia inflata (U. inflata var. minor) before being recognized as a distinct species. Although the inflated spokes look like flotation organs, their main role is to stabilize and elevate the inflorescence, while the plant relies on its internal buoyancy for floating.
