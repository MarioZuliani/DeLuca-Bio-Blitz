## Natural history notes

The American Oak Beauty (Phaeoura quernaria) is a large moth of eastern North America, well camouflaged with mottled brown and gray wings that resemble tree bark. It is most often found in oak woodlands, where its caterpillars feed on the leaves of oaks and related trees. Adults are nocturnal and attracted to lights, though their cryptic patterns make them nearly invisible during the day. By cycling nutrients through leaf consumption, its larvae play a role in forest food webs.
