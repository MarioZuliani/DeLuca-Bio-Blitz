## Natural history notes

The Largeflower Pusley (Richardia grandiflora) is a low-growing perennial native to Central/South America but naturalized in the southeastern United States. It produces clusters of showy pink to lavender flowers that attract bees and butterflies throughout much of the year. Often found in sandy soils, roadsides, and disturbed areas, it spreads quickly and can form dense mats. Though sometimes considered a weed, it provides nectar resources for pollinators in open habitats.
