## Natural history notes

Virginia Creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia) is a vigorous, climbing vine native to eastern North America, often seen covering trees, fences, and walls. It attaches with small adhesive pads, allowing it to scale surfaces without harming them structurally. In autumn, its leaves turn a brilliant red, and its dark blue berries provide food for birds and small mammals. While sometimes mistaken for poison ivy, it can be distinguished by its five leaflets instead of three.
