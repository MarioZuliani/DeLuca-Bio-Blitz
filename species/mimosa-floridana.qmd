## Natural history notes

The Florida Sensitive Briar (Mimosa floridana) is a sprawling, thorny legume native to the sandy pinelands and scrub habitats of Florida and the southeastern United States. It produces round, pink, puffball-like flowers that attract bees and butterflies in spring and summer. True to its name, its fernlike leaves fold inward when touchedâ€”a fascinating defense against herbivores and excessive sunlight. As a nitrogen-fixer, it also enriches the poor, sandy soils where it grows.
