## Natural history notes

Buren's Pyramid Ants (Dorymyrmex bureni) are characterized by their reddish-brown color and pyramid-like projection on their thorax. Only reproductive males and females will have wings present during the mating seasons. Colonies consist of a few thousand ants. Buren's Pyramid Ants are diurnal foragers and will typically feed on insects. Although they pose no harm to humans, they will fight against fire ants to defend their territory.
