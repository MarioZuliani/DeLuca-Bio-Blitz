## Natural history notes

The American Frogbit (Limnobium spongia) is a floating aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States, often found in ponds, bayous, and slow-moving rivers. Its round, floating leaves resemble small water lilies, while spongy undersides help them stay buoyant. In summer, it produces small white flowers with yellow centers that rise just above the waterâ€™s surface. By providing shelter for fish and invertebrates, it plays an important role in healthy wetland ecosystems.
