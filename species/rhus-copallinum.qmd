## Natural history notes

The Shining Sumac (Rhus copallinum) is a shrub or small tree native to eastern North America, often found in dry woodlands, roadsides, and open fields. It is easily recognized by its glossy, winged leaves and brilliant red fall color. Dense clusters of red fruits persist into winter, providing food for birds and other wildlife. By spreading into open areas, it helps stabilize soils and support early successional habitats.
