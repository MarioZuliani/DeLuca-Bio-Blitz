## Natural history notes

The Lanceleaf Arrowhead (Sagittaria lancifolia) is a tall aquatic plant native to wetlands, marshes, and ditches of the southeastern United States. It is named for its long, lance-shaped leaves that rise well above the waterâ€™s surface. In summer, it produces white, three-petaled flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its tubers and seeds provide food for ducks, muskrats, and other wetland wildlife, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems.
