## Natural history notes

The American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) is a keystone predator of the southeastern United States, thriving in swamps, marshes, rivers, and lakes. They are opportunistic feeders, eating everything from fish and turtles to birds and mammals, and their famous “gator holes” provide vital wetland refuges for countless other species. Females build large vegetation nests and guard their eggs fiercely, with nest temperature determining the sex of the hatchlings. Once nearly hunted to extinction for their hides, the species rebounded after legal protections and is now celebrated as a major conservation success story.
