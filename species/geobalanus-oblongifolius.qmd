## Natural history notes

The Gopher Apple (Geobalanus oblongifolius) is a low, spreading shrub native to the sandy soils of the southeastern United States. It produces small, plum-like fruits that are a favorite food of the gopher tortoise, as well as deer and other wildlife. The plantâ€™s dense, mat-forming growth helps stabilize soils and provides ground cover in dry, open habitats. Though not widely known, it plays an important role in supporting species of conservation concern like the gopher tortoise.
