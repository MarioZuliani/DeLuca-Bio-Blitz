## Natural history notes

The Florida Pricklypear (Opuntia austrina), also known as Devil's-tongue, is a cactus that is endemic to Florida. It is most commonly found in xeric (dry), sandy habitats of South Florida, such as scrub, scrubby flatwoods, and inland dunes. The flower from this cactus is very attractive to pollinators, such as the dotted skipper (Hesperia attalus).The spines, however, are something to watch out for: they can grow 2-3 centimeters in length! Some people eat the purple/red fruit that this plant produces, making jams and syrups or slicing and grilling it with lime.
