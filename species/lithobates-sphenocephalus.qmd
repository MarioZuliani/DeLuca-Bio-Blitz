## Natural history notes

The southern leopard frog (Lithobates sphenocephalus) is a species of “true” frog recognized by its raised ridges along the sides of the body and the large dark spots scattered across its back. Its diet consists primarily of insects and aquatic invertebrates, and it is most often found in or near freshwater habitats. The southern leopard frog is one of seven species in the genus Lithobates found in Florida, along with the American bullfrog, bronze frog, carpenter frog, Florida bog frog, pig frog, and river frog.
