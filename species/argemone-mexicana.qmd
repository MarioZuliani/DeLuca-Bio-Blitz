## Natural history notes

Mexican prickly poppy (Argenome mexicana) is a native plant in the poppy (Papaveraceae) family. Often, this plant is confused with a thistle because of its prickly leaves but can be easily distinguished from thistles based on its yellow flowers, if present, or its latex-like sap. While this is a native plant, it is considered a weed and is typically managed for by herbicides. It is also toxic to livestock!
