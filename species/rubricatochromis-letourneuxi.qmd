## Natural history notes

Letourneuxâ€™s Jewel Cichlid (Rubricatochromis letourneuxi) is a brightly colored freshwater fish native to rivers and lakes of northern Africa. It is known for its vibrant red body speckled with iridescent blue spots, which become even more striking during breeding season. This species is highly territorial, with pairs fiercely defending nests where eggs and fry are guarded by both parents. Though valued in the aquarium trade, it can become invasive outside its native range, competing with local fish for food and habitat.
