## Natural history notes

Alligatorweed (Alternanthera philoxeroides) is an invasive plant that first arrived in Florida over 100 years ago. Originally from South America, it has spread widely across the state and often takes over shorelines, where it harms native habitats. In the 1960s and 1970s, scientists brought in three insects from its native range—a flea beetle, a thrips, and a stem borer—to help keep it under control. These insects have done a good job of reducing alligatorweed in many places, and managers can still use them when needed. But even with these efforts, the plant has never been completely removed from Florida and remains a problem today.
