## Natural history notes

Michaux's snoutbean (Rhynchosia michauxii) is a small native plant found in drier conditions. A member of the legume (Fabaceae) family, this plant's roots form relationships with soil bacteria to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere into the soil. By doing this, legumes aid in restoring soil health, as they replenish the amount of nitrogen available in the sediment for other plants to use.
