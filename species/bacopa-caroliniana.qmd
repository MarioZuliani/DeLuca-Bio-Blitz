## Natural history notes

The Carolina Water-Hyssop (Bacopa caroliniana) is a creeping aquatic plant native to wetlands, ponds, and ditches across the southeastern United States. It has thick, succulent leaves that emit a lemony scent when crushed and produces small, pale blue to lavender flowers. The plant provides shelter for aquatic invertebrates and helps stabilize muddy shorelines. Its tolerance for submersion and attractive foliage have also made it popular in aquariums and water gardens.
