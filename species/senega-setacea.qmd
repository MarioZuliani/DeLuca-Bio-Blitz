## Natural history notes

The Coastal Plain Milkwort (Senega setacea) is a delicate wildflower native to the sandy soils and pine flatwoods of the southeastern United States. It produces slender spikes of small pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting bees and other pollinators. This species is adapted to dry, fire-maintained habitats, where it contributes to the rich diversity of groundcover plants. Though easily overlooked, it plays a role in supporting pollinator communities in fragile ecosystems.
