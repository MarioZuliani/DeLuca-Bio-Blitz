## Natural history notes

The Wild Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) is a large, ground-dwelling bird native to North America, best known for its fan-shaped tail and gobbling calls. It forages on the forest floor for acorns, seeds, berries, and insects, often scratching through leaf litter in search of food. Males, called toms, put on elaborate displays in springâ€”strutting, fanning their tails, and puffing up feathers to attract hens. Once nearly extirpated due to overhunting and habitat loss, Wild Turkeys have made a remarkable recovery through conservation efforts and reintroductions.
