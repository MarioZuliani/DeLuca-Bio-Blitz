## Natural history notes

The Deceptive Bluestem (Anatherum campbellii) is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States, typically found in dry, sandy habitats and open woodlands. Like other bluestems, it plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing cover for small animals and insects. Its flowers and seeds support grassland biodiversity, offering food for insects and birds. Though not widely known, it contributes to the resilience of native plant communities in fire-adapted ecosystems.
