## Natural history notes

The Tropical Soda-Apple (Solanum viarum) is an invasive shrub native to South America that has spread widely across the southeastern United States. It forms dense, thorny thickets that crowd out native vegetation and reduce pasture quality. The plant produces round, mottled green-and-white fruits resembling tiny watermelons, which are eaten by wildlife and livestock, aiding seed dispersal. Because of its rapid growth and persistence, it is considered a serious agricultural and ecological pest.
