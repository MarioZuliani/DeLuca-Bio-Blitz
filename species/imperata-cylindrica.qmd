## Natural history notes

The Cogon Grass (Imperata cylindrica) has long yellow-green leaves with an obviously off-center midrib and slightly serrated margins. Its height means that cogongrass often stands out from surrounding vegetation, making it easy to spot from a distance. It is a highly flammable pyrophyte, and can spread rapidly by colonizing disturbed areas and encouraging more frequent wildfires. It is regarded as an excellent plant for thatching the roofs of traditional homes throughout south-east Asia, and is even grown as a crop for this purpose. A common expression in the Philippines is ningas kugon ('cogon brush fire'). It is a figure of speech for quitters, specifically people who show a fervent interest in a new project but lose interest quickly, in reference to the propensity of cogongrass to catch fire and burn out quickly.
