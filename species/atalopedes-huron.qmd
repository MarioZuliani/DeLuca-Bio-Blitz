## Natural history notes

The Huron Sachem (Atalopedes huron) is a small, bright orange skipper butterfly found in open grassy habitats and coastal plains of the southeastern United States. Males are known for their territorial behavior, often perching on tall grasses to watch for rivals or potential mates. The caterpillars feed on native grasses, making the species an important part of grassland food webs. Adults visit a wide variety of flowers for nectar, contributing to local pollination networks.
