## Natural history notes

The Blue-gray Gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea) is a tiny, restless songbird of woodlands and thickets across much of North America. It flits constantly through foliage, wagging its long tail as it snaps up insects and spiders. Its high, thin calls and buzzy song are often heard before the bird is seen. During breeding season, pairs build delicate, lichen-covered nests that resemble small knots on tree branches.
