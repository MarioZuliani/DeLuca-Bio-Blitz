## Natural history notes

The Torpedo Grass (Panicum repens) is a perennial rhizomatous grass. It spreads primarily through creeping, sharply pointed rhizomes that can penetrate deep into soil and waterlogged sediments, forming dense monocultures in wetlands, ditches, and along lakeshores. It thrives under a wide range of conditions, tolerating drought, periodic flooding, salinity, and nutrient-poor soils. First introduced to the U.S. for forage and erosion control, it quickly became one of Floridaâ€™s worst invasive grasses, now covering tens of thousands of acres.
