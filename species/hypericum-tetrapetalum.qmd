## Natural history notes

The Fourpetal St. Johnswort (Hypericum tetrapetalum) is a perennial shrub native to the wetlands and pine flatwoods of the southeastern United States. It is easily recognized by its bright yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters during the warm months. This species thrives in moist, sandy soils and often plays a role in stabilizing wetland edges. Like other St. Johnsworts, it has a long history of traditional medicinal use, though its primary ecological role is providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
