## Natural history notes

The Yellow Colicroot (Aletris lutea) is a perennial wildflower native to the sandy pinelands and savannas of the southeastern United States. It produces a tall spike of small, yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring and summer. The plant is adapted to dry, fire-prone habitats and is often found alongside other specialist wildflowers. Historically, its bitter roots were used in folk medicine, giving rise to the name “colicroot.”
