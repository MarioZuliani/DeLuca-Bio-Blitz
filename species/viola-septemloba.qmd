## Natural history notes

The Southern Coastal Violet (Viola septemloba) is a low-growing wildflower native to sandy soils and open woodlands of the southeastern United States. It is easily recognized by its deep purple, five-petaled flowers and distinctive, lobed leaves. Blooming in early spring, it provides an important nectar source for bees and other pollinators. Like many violets, its leaves also serve as host plants for fritillary butterfly caterpillars.
