## Natural history notes

Licorice Weed (Scoparia dulcis) is a small, weedy herb native to the tropics but now widespread in the southeastern United States. It produces tiny white flowers along slender stems and is commonly found in disturbed soils, fields, and roadsides. The plant gets its name from the faintly sweet taste of its leaves, which have been used in traditional medicine in many cultures. Despite its modest size, it provides nectar for small bees and flies in open habitats.
