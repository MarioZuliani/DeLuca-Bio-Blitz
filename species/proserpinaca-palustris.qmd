## Natural history notes

Marsh mermaidweed (Proserpinaca palustris) is a common, native plant found throughout wetlands in eastern North America. This plant was named by Carl Linnaeus, the father of modern nomenclature. Its genus, Proserpinaca, originates from the Roman goddess Proserpina, known in Greek mythology as Persephone. In Greek and Roman mythology, Proserpina/Persephone is the goddess of both the spring and the underworld, so this plant's name pays homage to the versatility of environments that this plant can inhabit. This plant's versatility and appearance also makes it popular in the aquarium trade!
