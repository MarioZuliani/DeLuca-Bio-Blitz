## Natural history notes

The Natal Grass (Melinis repens) is a perennial (often short-lived) tufted grass in the family Poaceae, native to southern Africa but widely naturalized across warm regions including Florida, the Caribbean, and the southern U.S. It is easily recognized by its silky, reddish-pink flower clusters (panicles), which mature to a silvery white as the seeds ripen, giving fields a shimmering appearance in sunlight. Its name Natal grass comes from the Natal region of South Africa, its place of origin. In Florida, it is listed as invasive species.
