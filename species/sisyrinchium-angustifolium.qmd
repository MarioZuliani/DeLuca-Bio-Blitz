## Natural history notes

The Narrow-leaved Blue-eyed Grass (Sisyrinchium angustifolium) is a delicate perennial in the iris family, native to meadows, open woods, and moist prairies across eastern North America. Despite its name, it isn’t a true grass—its slender leaves simply resemble one. In spring, it produces small, star-shaped blue to violet flowers with bright yellow centers that attract bees and other pollinators. This charming wildflower adds subtle color and ecological value to grassy habitats.
