## Natural history notes

The American Pokeweed (Phytolacca americana) is widely dispersed by birds and quickly colonizes exposed mineral soil even in undisturbed forests, such as on tree-fall tip-up mounds or flood scours. It is most abundant, however, as a weed of urban, suburban, and agricultural disturbances. Be carefule! Its berries and mature stems are poisonous; the young stems have been used as a potherb and the purple berries as a source of ink. Although all parts of the Pokeweed are poisonous to humans, some folks take the risk of eating poke salad each spring.
