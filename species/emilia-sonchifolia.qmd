## Natural history notes

The Swamp Shield-Fern (Cyclosorus interruptus) is a robust, moisture-loving fern native to wetlands, swamps, and marsh edges of the southeastern United States. It forms dense clumps of bright green fronds that can reach over a meter tall, providing shelter for small animals and amphibians. Reproducing by spores, it thrives in consistently wet, shaded environments. Its presence is often a good indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland habitats.
