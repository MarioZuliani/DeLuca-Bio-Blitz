## Natural history notes

Nashâ€™s Bluestem (Anatherum subtile) is a native grass of the southeastern United States, typically growing in dry, sandy soils and open pinelands. Its fine stems and clumping growth form provide cover for insects and small animals, while its seeds are eaten by birds and other wildlife. Like many native grasses, it plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting fire-adapted ecosystems. Though often overlooked, it contributes to the diversity and health of native grassland communities.
