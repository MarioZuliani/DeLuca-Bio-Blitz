## Natural history notes

The Anhinga (Anhinga anhinga) is a waterbird found throughout the southeastern United States. It hunts fish by diving and swimming underwater. The species is also known as the “snakebird,” since only its slender neck and beak are visible above the water while swimming, giving it the appearance of a snake. Another common name, “water turkey,” comes from its long tail, which can fan out like that of a turkey.
