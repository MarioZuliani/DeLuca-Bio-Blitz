## Natural history notes

Water Spangles (Salvinia minima) is a small, free-floating aquatic fern native to Central and South America but widely introduced in the southeastern United States. It forms dense mats of overlapping, oval leaves covered in tiny water-repelling hairs, giving them a velvety appearance. These mats provide shelter for aquatic invertebrates and small fish but can also block sunlight and reduce oxygen levels when they spread excessively. Because of its rapid growth, it is considered invasive in many regions.
