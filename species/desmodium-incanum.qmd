## Natural history notes

The Creeping Beggarweed (Desmodium incanum) is a perennial (or subshrubby) legume in the family Fabaceae, spreading via both stolons/runners and seed. Because it is a nitrogen-fixing legume, the Creeping Beggarweed can improve soil fertility (adding nitrogen to soils via root symbiosis with rhizobia), which is why it was once promoted as a forage or cover plant in tropical and subtropical regions. Though useful in some systems, it is considered a weed in many places (including Florida), partly because of its aggressive vegetative spread and capacity to colonize lawns, gardens, and turf.
