## Natural history notes

The Dwarf Huckleberry (Gaylussacia dumosa) is a low, deciduous shrub native to the sandy pine forests and scrublands of the southeastern United States. In spring, it produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers that attract bees. By summer, these give way to dark blue berries that are eaten by birds, mammals, and people alike. Its dense, shrubby growth helps stabilize soils and contributes to the rich understory diversity of fire-adapted ecosystems.
