## Natural history notes

The Eastern Cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus) is the most common rabbit in North America, easily recognized by the fluffy white underside of its tail. It thrives in fields, meadows, and brushy edges, where it feeds mainly on grasses, herbs, and garden plants. Highly prolific, females can produce several litters per year, each with multiple young. As a key prey species for hawks, foxes, coyotes, and other predators, it plays an essential role in many food webs.
