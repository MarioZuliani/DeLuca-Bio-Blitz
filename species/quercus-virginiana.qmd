## Natural history notes

The Southern Live Oak (Quercus virginiana) is found throughout southeastern United States, often draped in Spanish moss and sprawling with massive, arching limbs. Unlike most oaks, it keeps its leathery leaves year-round, providing shade and shelter in coastal woodlands and urban landscapes. Its acorns are an important food source for birds, squirrels, and deer, supporting a wide range of wildlife. Historically, its dense, durable wood was prized for shipbuilding, including the hulls of early American naval vessels.
