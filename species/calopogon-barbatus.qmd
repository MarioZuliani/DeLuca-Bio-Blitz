## Natural history notes

The Bearded Grasspink (Calopogon barbatus) is a striking native orchid of the southeastern United States, found in wet pine savannas, bogs, and wet meadows. It produces vibrant pink to magenta flowers with a distinctive, beard-like cluster of yellow-tipped hairs on the upper petal that attract pollinators. Interestingly, the flower is non-rewardingâ€”it tricks visiting bees into aiding pollination without offering nectar. This beautiful species thrives in open, sunny, fire-maintained wetlands.
