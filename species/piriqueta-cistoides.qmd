## Natural history notes

The Pitted Stripeseed (Piriqueta cistoides) is a delicate wildflower of the southeastern United States and the Caribbean, thriving in sandy soils and open habitats. It produces bright yellow, five-petaled flowers that open for a single day, attracting bees and other pollinators. Its seeds have a distinctive pitted surface, giving the plant its common name. Though small and often overlooked, it contributes to the rich diversity of dry, coastal ecosystems.
