## Natural history notes

Eastern Phoebes (Sayornis phoebe) are often known to be a "plump" songbird with a medium-length tail. They are a brownish-gray color on top, with their head being the darkest part. Underneath, they are a pale color with a faint yellow on their belly during the fall. Their diet consists of flying insects including wasps, beetles, and butterflies. Eastern Phoebe nests can be found within 15 feet to the ground under overhangs to keep their young protected from predators. It is the female that constructs the nest out of mud, moss, leaves, and animal hair.
