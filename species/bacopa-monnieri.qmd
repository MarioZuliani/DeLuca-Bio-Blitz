## Natural history notes

The Herb-of-grace (Bacopa monnieri) is a creeping, mat-forming perennial that occurs naturally in coastal hammocks and swales, swamps, salt and freshwater marshes, and along river, stream and ditch edges. It attracts a variety of small pollinators, and is a larval host plant for the White peacock butterfly. It has a similar appearance as its cousin, Lemon bacopa (Bacopa caroliniana), and is found in similar habitats. To differentiate them, crush a leaf. If you smell lemon, you know you have Lemon bacopa. Herb-of-grace will not emit a scent.
