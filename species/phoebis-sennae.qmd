## Natural history notes

The cloudless sulphur (Phoebis sennae) is a vibrant yellow butterfly that is common throughout Florida. It occurs in a variety of habitats but tends to breed in disturbed, open areas. The eggs are laid white and gradually turn orange as they mature. Cloudless sulphurs migrate south for the winter, so they are most abundant in Florida during the fall, especially in open habitats. Their host plants are various species in the pea family.
