## Natural history notes

The Golden Polypody (Phlebodium aureum) is a large, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including the southeastern United States. It grows on tree trunks and branches, using them for support while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its blue-green, lobed fronds and golden-brown spore clusters on the underside give the species its name. By forming lush mats on trees, it helps retain humidity and provides habitat for small invertebrates.
