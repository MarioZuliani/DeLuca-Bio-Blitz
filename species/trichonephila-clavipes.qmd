## Natural history notes

The Golden Silk Spider (Trichonephila clavipes) is characterized by its large orange and brown body with feathery tufts on its legs. Feamles are much larger than males and are more brightly colored than the inconspicuous male. Adult males are found between July and September while females mature in Augsut until the late fall. They create very large webs to catch prey including flies, bees, and small moths.
