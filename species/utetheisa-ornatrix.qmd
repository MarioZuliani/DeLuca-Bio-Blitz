## Natural history notes

The Ornate Bella Moth (Utetheisa ornata) is a small moth known for its yellow front wings with white bands and black dots, and bright pink hindwings. The larvae are orange-brown with broad black bands on each segment with white spots. Unlike most moths, the Ornate Bella Moth is diurnal. Plant species from the genus Crotalaria serve as the main host plant for these moths. Due to the presence of pyrrolizidine alkaloids in Crotalaria plants, Ornate Bella Moths in all stages become poisonous to predators.
