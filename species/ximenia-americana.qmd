## Natural history notes

The Hog Plum (Ximenia americana) is a thorny shrub or small tree found in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, often growing in dry woodlands and savannas. It produces small yellow fruits that are edible but sour, eaten by both people and wildlife. Its leaves and flowers provide browse for animals, while birds and mammals help disperse its seeds. Traditionally, various parts of the plant have also been used in folk medicine.
