## Natural history notes

Sand cordgrass (Sporobolus bakeri), also called marsh grass, is a native grass found in the southeastern United States. This is a tall grass, typically 3-6 feet tall, and is typically found in clumps. While this grass is typically found in wetlands, it can live in upland areas, too, making it robust to a variety of different landscapes throughout Florida. Its appearance and tolerance for a variety of environmental conditions also makes it a popular ornamental plant! This plant was also recently reclassified from Spartina bakeri to Sporobolus bakeri, so it may still appear as Spartina bakeri in some sources.
