## Natural history notes

The Sweetbay Magnolia (Magnolia virginiana) is a semi-evergreen to evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States, often found in swamps, wet woods, and along streams. It typically grows 10–20 m tall, with smooth gray bark and glossy, lanceolate leaves that are dark green above and silvery-white beneath. It is sometimes called “beaver tree” because trappers used its twigs as bait for beaver traps, taking advantage of the species’ sweet fragrance. It is widely planted in landscapes for its fragrance, attractive foliage, and tolerance of wet soils.
