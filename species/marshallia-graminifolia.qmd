## Natural history notes

The Grassleaf Barbara's-Buttons (Marshallia graminifolia) is a perennial wildflower native to the southeastern United States, where it grows in pine flatwoods, savannas, wet meadows, and along pond margins. It is easily recognized by its dense, globe-shaped flower heads of white to pale pink florets, which bloom atop wiry stems in late spring and summer. The common name Barbaraâ€™s buttons comes from the rounded, button-like flower clusters. Because of its showy blooms, it is sometimes used in native wildflower gardens, especially in pollinator-friendly plantings.
