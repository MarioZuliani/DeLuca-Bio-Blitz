## Natural history notes

The Salt Marsh Moth (Estigmene acrea) is characterized by their white wings with irregular black spots. Males have yellow hind wings, while females have white hind wings. Most of their abdominal segments are yellow with large black spots. During the larval stage, there are five to seven instars. In each instar stage, they are typically a dark color, while sometimes they will be a yellow-ish brown instead. As they progress, not only do they grow larger in size, but the number and length of their hairs increase. Their host plants include broadleaf weeds, but will commonly be found on many field crops.
