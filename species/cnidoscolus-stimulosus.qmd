## Natural history notes

The Spurge Nettle (Cnidoscolus stimulosus) is a native wildflower of the southeastern United States, commonly found in dry, sandy soils and open pinelands. Despite its attractive white, five-petaled flowers, the plant is covered in stinging hairs that can cause a painful rash on contact. It produces small, spiny fruits and serves as a host plant for several butterfly species, including the gray hairstreak. Its striking mix of beauty and defense makes it a memorable component of sandy upland habitats.
