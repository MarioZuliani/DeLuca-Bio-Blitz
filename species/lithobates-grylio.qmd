## Natural history notes

The pig frog (Lithobates grylio) is a large species of “true” frog that ranges in color from greenish to nearly black. Its diet consists primarily of insects, but it will also eat fish and other amphibians. Pig frogs are most often found in or near freshwater habitats. They are one of seven species in the genus Lithobates that occur in Florida, along with the American bullfrog, bronze frog, carpenter frog, Florida bog frog, river frog, and southern leopard frog. Pig frogs can be distinguished by their hind feet which are webbed nearly to the tips, and by the bold dark spots on the backs of their legs.
