## Natural history notes

The osprey (Pandion haliaetus) is a native raptor found in every state in the United States. These birds primarily eat fish, and they are excellent fishermen. They catch one out of every four fish they hunt! When they catch a fish, they will orient the head straight, into the wind, as they fly away from the water so that it is more aerodynamic. Ospreys are generally migratory, but in Florida (and other parts of the southeast), these raptors mostly stay year-round, with a few exceptions in the southern parts of the state.
