## Natural history notes

The magnolia green jumping spider (Lyssomanes viridis) is a translucent green species that blends in with vegetation. It is most often found on or near evergreen trees such as live oak and southern magnolia, which give the spider its common name. Unlike many spiders, it does not build webs, but instead leaps to capture its prey. This species is harmless to humans and helps regulate insect populations.
