## Natural history notes

The peninsular cooter (Pseudemys peninsularis) is one of three cooter species found in Florida, along with the Florida red-bellied cooter (Pseudemys nelsoni) and the river cooter (Pseudemys concinna). Widespread across the state, the peninsular cooter inhabits a variety of freshwater bodies and feeds primarily on aquatic plants. They are most often spotted basking along shorelines, on logs, or among other debris.
