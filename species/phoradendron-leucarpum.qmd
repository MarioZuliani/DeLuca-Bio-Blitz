## Natural history notes

The American Mistletoe (Phoradendron leucarpum) is a species of mistletoe in the Viscaceae family which is native to the United States and Mexico. It is hemiparasitic, living in the branches of trees. It is used in North America as a surrogate for the similar European mistletoe Viscum album, in Christmas decoration and associated traditions, as well as in rituals by modern druids. It is commercially harvested and sold for those purposes. It is the state floral emblem for the state of Oklahoma.
