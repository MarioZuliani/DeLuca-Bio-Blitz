## Natural history notes

The Whitesnow (Drymaria cordata) is native to moist habitats in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa, and has been introduced to many places in the tropics and subtropics, including the southeast US. It is known as one of the most aggressive weeds of the tropical and subtropical parts of the world. The North American distribution probably all adventive (not reported for the Southeastern US by Chapman 1883, Mohr 1901, or Small 1903). Its weed is weak-stemmed, breaking easily and effortlessly spreading to other areas. Seeds and fruit will stick to clothing, shoes, pets and other items from the yard.
