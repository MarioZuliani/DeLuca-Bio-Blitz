## Natural history notes

The Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) can be easily identified by a black "V" on their yellow chest. They also have a characteristic brown streaking along their back. Females will typically lay 3-5 eggs that are white with brown and purple spotting. Eastern Meadowlarks will forage on the ground, eating insects and seeds. Populations over recent decades have been in decline due to the decrease in both amount and quality of habitat.
