## Natural history notes

The Pine Warbler (Setophaga pinus) is a small songbird of the eastern United States, closely tied to pine forests where it nests and forages. Unlike many warblers, it eats a varied diet of insects, seeds, and berries, often visiting backyard feeders in winter. Its clear, musical trill is one of the first bird songs heard in spring, sometimes continuing year-round in warmer regions. This species is considered an important indicator of healthy pine ecosystems.
