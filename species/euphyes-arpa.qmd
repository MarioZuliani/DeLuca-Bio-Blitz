## Natural history notes

The Palmetto Skipper (Euphyes arpa) is a stout, dark brown butterfly found in the coastal plains and pine flatwoods of the southeastern United States. It is closely associated with saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), whose leaves serve as the sole food source for its caterpillars. Adults fly low and fast, feeding on nectar from a variety of flowers, especially in sunny openings. Because of its reliance on palmetto-dominated habitats, it benefits from the maintenance of healthy, fire-managed ecosystems.
