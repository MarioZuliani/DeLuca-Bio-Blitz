## Natural history notes

The Purple Bladderwort (Utricularia purpurea) is a submersed aquatic plant. The epithet purpurea means “purple,” referencing the distinctive purple or lavender coloration of its flowers. In some northern parts of its range (e.g. Wisconsin), it has sometimes grown into dense surface mats that impair recreation (tangled boats, etc.), especially in years when populations “boom”. In such dense masses, many plants may not flower; flowering seems tied to conditions that let the floral stalk maintain elevation above water (sometimes aided by surrounding vegetation like water lilies).
