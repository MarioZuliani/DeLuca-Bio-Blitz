## Natural history notes

The Ornate Pennant (Celithemis ornata) is a small dragonfly of the southeastern United States, often found near ponds, marshes, and slow-moving waters. It is strikingly patterned, with red and black markings on its wings and body that give it a distinctive, ornamental look. Like other dragonflies, it is a skilled aerial hunter, feeding on mosquitoes and other small flying insects. Its presence is also an indicator of healthy freshwater habitats.
