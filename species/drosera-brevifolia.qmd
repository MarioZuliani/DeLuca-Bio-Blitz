## Natural history notes

The Dwarf Sundew (Drosera brevifolia) is one of the smallest carnivorous plants in North America, typically found in sandy, nutrient-poor soils of the southeastern United States. Its tiny, red, spoon-shaped leaves are covered in sticky hairs that trap and digest insects to supplement its nutrient intake. The plant produces delicate pink flowers that rise just above the leaves in spring. Despite its miniature size, it plays an important role in balancing insect populations in its fragile habitats.
