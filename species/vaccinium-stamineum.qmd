## Natural history notes

The Florida Deerberry (Vaccinium stamineum) is a variety of Deerberry distinguished by its pedicels and twigs lacking stipitate glands, and smooth fruits. Its common name “Deerberry” comes from the fact that deer, as well as other mammals and many bird species, eat both the foliage and fruits. It is fire-adapted: it has woody rhizomes underground, so even when aboveground branches burn, the plant resprouts. It is buzz-pollinated by bees (i.e., pollinators vibrate their flight muscles to dislodge pollen from poricidal anthers), which is an interesting specialized pollination mode among the Vaccinium group.
