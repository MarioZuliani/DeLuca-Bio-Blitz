## Natural history notes

The Twin-spot Skipper (Oligoria maculata) is a small butterfly of the southeastern United States, usually found in moist meadows, marsh edges, and grassy openings. It is named for the distinctive paired white spots on its forewings, which help distinguish it from similar skipper species. Adults feed on nectar from a variety of flowers, while the caterpillars develop on grasses. Although often overlooked due to its quick, darting flight, it plays a quiet role in pollination and grassland food webs.
