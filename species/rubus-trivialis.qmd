## Natural history notes

The Southern Dewberry (Rubus trivialis) is a trailing bramble native to the southeastern United States, commonly found along roadsides, woodland edges, and open fields. It produces white, five-petaled flowers in spring, followed by sweet black berries that are eaten by birds, mammals, and people alike. Its thorny, creeping stems provide cover for small animals and help stabilize soil in disturbed areas. As one of the first brambles to fruit each year, itâ€™s an important early food source for wildlife.
