## Natural history notes

American Flagfish (Jordanella floridae) is a small, native fish found in Florida, though it has been found as a nonnative in a few small areas in the southeast. A colorful, iridescent fish, flagfish are common in the aquarium trade, and its nonnative introductions are likely the result of its popularity there. A type of killifish, these fish like shallow, warm water and can be found near aquatic plants. These fish earned the name “flagfish” because males have a red and white striped pattern, resembling the American flag.
