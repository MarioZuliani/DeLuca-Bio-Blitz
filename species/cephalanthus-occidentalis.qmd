## Natural history notes

The Buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis) is a wetland shrub native to much of North America, thriving along pond edges, marshes, and swamps. It is easily recognized by its spherical clusters of fragrant white flowers, which attract bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. Its seeds are eaten by ducks and other waterfowl, making it valuable for wetland wildlife. Because it tolerates flooding, it also helps stabilize shorelines and improve water quality.
