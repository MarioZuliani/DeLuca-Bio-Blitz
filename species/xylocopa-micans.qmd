Southern Carpenter Bees (Xylocopa micans) look similar to the more widespread Eastern Carpenter Bee (Xylocopa virginica) howver, males have a greenish-blue abdomen rather than purple. Female Southern Carpenter Bees are black with a purple body unlike Eastern Carpenter Bees which are all black. They are mostly found from March to November. They will take nectar from various different flowers by biting through the base of the flower.
