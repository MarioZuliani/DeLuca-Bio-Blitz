## Natural history notes

Eastern Leaf-footed Bugs (Leptoglossus phyllopus) is characterized by it's unique body shape, brown coloration, and horizontal white bar across its back. Nymphs have a similar shape as the adults, however are an red-orange color with black limbs and spotting. Unlike adults, nymphs lack the "leaf-like foot" or flattened hind tibial expansions. Their primary host plants are thistles (Cirsium spp.). However, Eastern Leaf-footed Bugs can be found on other flowering plants we commonly use for agriculture, such as citrus, pecans, apples, blueberries, etc, and cause the fruits to drop early. Due to being an agricultural pest, they are usually controlled in these areas through insecticides, cultural practices, and hand picking.
