## Natural history notes

The Broad-leaved Goldenaster (Pityopsis latifolia) is a rhizomatous perennial herb in the aster family. This taxon has a tangled taxonomic history: it has been placed in genera like Chrysopsis, Heterotheca, and has been considered a variety of Pityopsis graminifolia. More recent treatments have elevated a narrowly defined Pityopsis latifolia as a Florida endemic, restricting its circumscription. It is adapted to fire-managed ecosystems: regular, low-intensity burns favor it by reducing competition from woody plants and encouraging flowering and resource allocation to belowground parts.
