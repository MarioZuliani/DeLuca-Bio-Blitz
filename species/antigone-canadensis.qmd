## Natural history notes

Sandhill Cranes (Antigone canadensis) are characterized by their long legs & long neck. They are gray in color with a patch of red skin on the top of their head. In flight, they can be seen with their neck stretch fully out. There are two subspecies in Florida: The Florida Sandhill Crane (non-migratory, year-round breeding resident) & the Greater Sandhill Crane (winters in Florida, nests in Great Lakes region). Sandhill Cranes are omnivores, feeding on seeds, grains, insects, lizards, etc.. One of their major threats is loss of habitat due to wetland drainage, development, or agriculture use.
