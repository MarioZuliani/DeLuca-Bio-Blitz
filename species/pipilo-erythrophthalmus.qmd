## Natural history notes

Eastern Towhees (Pipilo erythrophthalmus) are characterized as a large sparrow with a thick, triangular beak for cracking seeds. Males are black above and on the breast with orange sides and a white belly. Females are similar but a brown color where the males are black. Their diet consists of seeds, fruit, insects, as well as flower buds in the spring. They usually nest on the ground in fallen leaves, laying around 2-6 eggs.
