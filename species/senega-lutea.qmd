## Natural history notes

Orange Milkwort (Senega lutea) is an herbaceous plant with yellow-orange flowers that bloom between April and October. Affectionately known as a Swamp Cheeto, you can see the bright flowers in damp sandy soils, typically adjacent to a wetland in the summer months in Florida. Orange Milkwort flowers are self-pollinating, but are spread by ants who consume fleshy elaisomes around the seed, but leave the seed itself in tact to germinate.
