## Natural history notes

The difoliate orbweaver (Acacesia hamata) is the only spider of the Acacesia genus native to U.S. It can be found throughout the eastern U.S. and, like most spiders, is typically more active at night. These spiders are orbweavers, which means that they create web "orbs" to catch prey. While there is still a lot to learn about this species, it has been observed that this spider builds their orb every evening and dismantles it before dawn.
