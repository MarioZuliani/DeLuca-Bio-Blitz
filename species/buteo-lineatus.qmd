## Natural history notes

Red-shouldered Hawks (Buteo lineatus) are known for their hooked bill and reddish colored "shoulders" and belly. Juveniles lack this red coloring and instead have almost white feathers with brown spotting. Their diet consists of small mammals, lizards, snakes, and amphibians. They typically breed in the late winter to spring (January-May). During the breeding season, Red-shouldered Hawks are very protective of their mate, nest, eggs, and chicks. If they feel threatened, they will swoop down from as far as 150 feet away.
