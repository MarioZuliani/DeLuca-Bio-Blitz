## Natural history notes

The Polyphemus moth (Antheraea polyphemus) is a large silk moth found across North America, ranging from Canada to Mexico. It ranks among Floridaâ€™s largest moth species. Each wing has a distinctive eyespot pattern, which the moth can flash open to startle predators. The species is named after Polyphemus, the one-eyed cyclops from Greek mythology, in reference to these prominent spots.
