## Natural history notes

The Colombian Waxweed (Cuphea carthagenensis) is a somewhat erect to sprawling herb (sometimes becoming weakly woody at the base) that often reaches about 30–60 cm in height, with many branches. The seed dispersal mechanism is rather unusual: a thickened “placenta” inside the fruit can elongate and force open the flower tube, ejecting seeds — somewhat like a little mechanical catapult. In its seed oil, it contains a very high proportion of lauric acid. It has a long history of use in traditional medicine: in South America it has been used as a diuretic, hypotensive, blood purifier, antiprotozoal, laxative, etc.
