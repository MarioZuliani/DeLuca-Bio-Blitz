## Natural history notes

The Bunchy Flat-Sedge (Cyperus polystachyos) is a perennial sedge native to much of the tropical and subtropical world and naturalized widely across warm regions. It grows 30–80 cm tall, with triangular stems and narrow leaves mostly at the base. Like other sedges, it has the characteristic 3-angled stems (“sedges have edges”). It is common in the Neotropics as a weed in grass lawns.
