## Natural history notes

The Combleaf Yellow False Foxglove (Aureolaria pectinata) is a native wildflower of the southeastern United States, typically found in sandy pine woods. Its bright yellow, tubular flowers bloom in late summer and attract bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. Like other false foxgloves, it is a hemiparasite, drawing some of its nutrients from the roots of nearby oak trees while still photosynthesizing on its own. This unique strategy helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils where many plants cannot.
