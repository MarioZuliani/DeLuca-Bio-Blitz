## Natural history notes

The Dwarf Bayberry (Morella pumila) is a small, aromatic shrub native to the sandy pinelands and coastal plains of the southeastern United States. It produces clusters of tiny, waxy berries that are an important winter food source for birds, especially tree swallows and yellow-rumped warblers. Like other bayberries, it enriches poor soils by fixing nitrogen through symbiotic root bacteria. Its low, dense growth helps stabilize sandy soils and contributes to the structure of fire-maintained ecosystems.
