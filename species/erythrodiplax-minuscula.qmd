## Natural history notes

The Little Blue Dragonlet (Erythrodiplax minuscula) is one of the smallest dragonflies in North America, commonly found around ponds, marshes, and slow streams in the southeastern United States. Males are powdery blue, while females are brownish with subtle markings, making them less conspicuous. Despite their tiny size, they are agile hunters of mosquitoes and other small insects. Their presence is often an indicator of healthy freshwater habitats.
