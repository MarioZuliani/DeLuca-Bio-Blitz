## Natural history notes

Swallow-tailed Kites (Elanoides forficatus) are black-and-white raptors known for their deeply forked tail. They spend the fall and winter in South America, then migrate north in early March to breed. Their nests are composed of small sticks and spanish moss high in cypress and pine trees. Their diet consists of primarily insects and small animals. They catch their prey by "hawking". Historically, Swallow-tailed Kites could be found up along the Mississippi River in Minnesota, however due to habitat destruction, they are now mainly found in Florida and a couple other southern states.
