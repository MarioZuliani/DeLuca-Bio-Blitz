## Natural history notes

The Carolina Ponysfoot (Dichondra carolinensis) is a perennial, mat-forming groundcover native to the southeastern United States and the Caribbean. It grows prostrate, rooting at the nodes, and forms dense carpets of small, kidney- to horseshoe-shaped leaves. Its dense mats can help suppress weeds. Because of its soft leaves and low growth, it is sometimes grown deliberately in gardens as a “living mulch”.
