## Natural history notes

The Coastalplain Chaffhead (Carphephorus corymbosus) is a perennial wildflower native to the sandy pinelands and flatwoods of the southeastern United States. It produces clusters of fluffy, purple flower heads in late summer and fall that attract butterflies, bees, and other pollinators. Adapted to fire-maintained habitats, it thrives in open conditions created by periodic burns. Its striking blooms add both beauty and ecological value to pine-dominated landscapes.
