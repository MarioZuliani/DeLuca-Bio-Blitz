## Natural history notes

Swamp Bay (Persea palustris) is an evergreen tree of the southeastern United States, typically growing in wetlands, swamps, and along stream edges. Its aromatic leaves resemble those of the related Redbay and are sometimes used as a spice substitute. The small, dark fruits are an important food source for birds and mammals, while the dense foliage offers year-round cover. Like other members of the laurel family, it is vulnerable to the invasive redbay ambrosia beetle, which spreads laurel wilt disease.
