## Natural history notes

Red-bellied Woodpeckers (Melanerpes carolinus) are known for their red cap and nape with black and white striping on their wings. Their face, chest, and belly are a pale color. Their diet consists mostly of insects, spiders, and other arthropods, but will also east acorns and nuts. Red-bellied Woodpeckers typically nest in dead hardwood or pine trees. They typically excavate a new nesting cavity each year below the previous one in the same tree.
