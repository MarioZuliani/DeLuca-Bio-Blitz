## Natural history notes

Regal Jumping Spiders (Phidippus regius) may be sexually dimorphic with the males always being black with white fringes on their legs, a white band and spots on their abdomen. They also have enlarged and green/blue iridescent chelicerae. Females may have this same patterning or their scales on their back may be gray, tan, brown, orange, or a combination. While immature Regal Jumping Spiders are often found in herbaceous zones, adults tend to favor palms and palmettos. Like other jumping spiders, Regal Jumping Spdiers do not use webs to catch prey, but they do use silk. They are also known to feed on a wide variety of other arthropods.
