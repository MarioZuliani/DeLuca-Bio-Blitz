## Natural history notes

The Low Pinebarren Milkwort (Senega ramosa) is a delicate wildflower native to the dry, sandy pine flatwoods and savannas of the southeastern United States. It bears clusters of small, rose-pink to purple flowers on slender stems that bloom in summer. This species thrives in open, fire-maintained habitats where competition is low. By supporting native bees and butterflies, it contributes to the ecological richness of longleaf pine ecosystems.
