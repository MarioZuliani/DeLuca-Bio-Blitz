## Natural history notes

The Castor Bean (Ricinus communis) is a fast-growing perennial shrub or small tree in the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae), native to Africa but now naturalized in warm regions worldwide. It can reach 2â€“5 m tall, with large, star-shaped leaves that are glossy and deeply lobed, giving it a tropical appearance. It produces spiny seed capsules containing mottled seeds that yield castor oil, used in medicine, cosmetics, and industry. Despite this utility, the seeds also contain ricin, a highly toxic protein. Ricin is so potent that just a few chewed seeds can be lethal, yet the purified oil is safe because ricin is water-soluble and not carried into the oil.
