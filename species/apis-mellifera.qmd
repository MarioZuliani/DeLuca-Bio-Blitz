## Natural history notes

The Western Honey Bee (Apis mellifera) is one of the worldâ€™s most widespread and important pollinators, originally native to Europe, Africa, and western Asia but now introduced globally. Living in highly organized colonies, they build wax combs to store honey and rear brood, with each hive containing a queen, workers, and drones. They play a critical ecological and agricultural role by pollinating a wide variety of plants, including many food crops. Though resilient and adaptable, honey bees face pressures from habitat loss, pesticides, diseases, and parasites such as the Varroa mite.
