## Natural history notes

The Fragrant Eryngo (Eryngium aromaticum) is a spiny, thistle-like wildflower native to the sandy soils of the southeastern United States. Despite its prickly appearance, it produces clusters of tiny, fragrant flowers that attract a wide range of pollinators, especially bees and butterflies. Its tough, drought-tolerant growth allows it to thrive in dry, open habitats where few other plants persist. As both a nectar source and a hardy ground cover, it supports pollinator diversity in fragile ecosystems.
