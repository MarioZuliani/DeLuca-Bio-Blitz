## Natural history notes

The Chalky Bluestem (Anatherum capillipes) is a perennial bunchgrass of the southeastern United States, often found in dry, sandy soils and pine flatwoods. It is named for the pale, bluish-white coating on its stems, which gives the plant a chalky appearance. Like other bluestems, it provides cover for insects and small animals while also stabilizing soils. Its seeds are eaten by birds, and its presence supports the biodiversity of fire-adapted ecosystems.
