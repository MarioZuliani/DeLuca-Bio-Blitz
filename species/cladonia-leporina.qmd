## Natural history notes

The Jester Lichen (Cladonia leporina) is a colorful, branching lichen commonly found on sandy soils, rotting wood, and open pine forests of the southeastern United States. It forms bright orange to red fruiting tips that stand out against its pale stalks, giving it a whimsical, “jester-like” appearance. Like other lichens, it is a symbiosis between a fungus and algae, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor habitats. It contributes to soil formation, moisture retention, and provides microhabitats for small invertebrates.
