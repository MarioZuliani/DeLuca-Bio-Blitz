## Natural history notes

The Manyflower Marshpennywort (Hydrocotyle umbellata) is a creeping aquatic or semi-aquatic plant found in marshes, ponds, and wet meadows across the southeastern United States. Its round, umbrella-like leaves grow on long stalks, floating on or just above the waterâ€™s surface. Clusters of tiny white flowers form in rounded umbels, giving the species its name. By spreading across wet soils, it helps prevent erosion and provides shelter for small aquatic animals.
