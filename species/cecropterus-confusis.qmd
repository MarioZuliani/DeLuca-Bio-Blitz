## Natural history notes

The Confused Cloudywing (Cecropterus confusis) is a medium-sized skipper butterfly found in open woods, fields, and edges across the southeastern United States. It is often difficult to distinguish from other cloudywing species, which is how it earned its name. Adults feed on nectar from a variety of flowers, while caterpillars develop on legumes such as tick-trefoils and bush-clovers. As both pollinators and prey for birds and other insects, they play a small but important role in local ecosystems.
