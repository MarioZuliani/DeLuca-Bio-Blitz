## Natural history notes

The Little Metalmark (Calephelis virginiensis) is one of the smallest butterflies in North America, recognized by the tiny metallic silver spots that shimmer on its orange-brown wings. It inhabits open sandy areas, pine flatwoods, and coastal plains of the southeastern United States. Adults feed on nectar from asters and other small wildflowers, while caterpillars specialize on plants in the aster family. Though inconspicuous in flight, its glittering wing spots give it a jewel-like appearance when seen up close.
