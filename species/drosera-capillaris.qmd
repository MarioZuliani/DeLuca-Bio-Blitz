## Natural history notes

The Pink Sundew (Drosera capillaris) is a small carnivorous plant found in nutrient-poor wetlands, bogs, and sandy soils across the southeastern United States. Its leaves are covered in sticky, glandular hairs that glisten in the sun and trap unsuspecting insects, which the plant digests to supplement its nutrient intake. Despite its delicate size, it plays an important role in balancing insect populations in its habitat. In spring, it produces tiny pink to white flowers that rise above the sticky leaves, ensuring pollinators donâ€™t get caught in its traps.
