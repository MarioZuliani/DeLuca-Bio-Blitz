## Natural history notes

The Seaside Primrose-Willow (Ludwigia maritima) is a perennial herb native to the coastal plain of the southeastern United States. It typically inhabits wet pine savannas, bogs, wet flatwoods, and seepage slopes, often in acidic, sandy soils. Its yellow flowers open in daylight and are visited by a variety of small bees and flies. Plants grow low and spreading, with prostrate to ascending stems that root at the nodes, forming mats in seasonally wet areas.
