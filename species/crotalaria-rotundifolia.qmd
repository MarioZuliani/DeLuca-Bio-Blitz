## Natural history notes

Rabbitbells (Crotalaria rotundifolia) is a low, spreading legume native to the sandy soils of the southeastern United States. It produces small, bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom through much of the growing season. As a nitrogen-fixer, it enriches poor soils while providing nectar for bees and other pollinators. Its seeds are contained in small pods that rattle when dry, a trait common to the rattlepods in the genus Crotalaria.
