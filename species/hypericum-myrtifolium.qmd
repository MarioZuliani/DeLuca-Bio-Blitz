## Natural history notes

The Myrtleleaf St. John’s Wort (Hypericum myrtifolium) is a shrub native to wetlands and moist flatwoods of the southeastern United States. It bears glossy, myrtle-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom through the summer, attracting a wide range of pollinators. Its tolerance for periodic flooding makes it an important stabilizer of wetland soils. The plant’s dense growth and long flowering season add color and structure to swamp and marsh edges.
