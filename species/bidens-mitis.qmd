## Natural history notes

The Smallfruit Beggarticks (Bidens mitis) is a native wildflower of wetlands, marsh edges, and ditches throughout the southeastern United States. It produces bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom from late summer into fall, providing nectar for bees, butterflies, and other pollinators. Its small, barbed seeds easily cling to fur and clothing, helping the plant disperse widely. By thriving in wet soils, it supports pollinator activity and stabilizes shoreline habitats.
