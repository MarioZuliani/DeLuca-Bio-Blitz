## Natural history notes

The Laurel Dodder (Cassytha filiformis) is a twining, parasitic vine widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, including Florida. It produces long, threadlike, leafless green stems that twine around host plants, attaching with haustoria that penetrate the host’s tissue to extract water and nutrients. In the Caribbean, it is commonly called “love vine”, tied to traditional folklore and used in folk medicine. Its presence in coastal ecosystems contributes to structural complexity, providing cover for insects and small animals, though it can also be a pest in orchards or disturbed landscapes.
