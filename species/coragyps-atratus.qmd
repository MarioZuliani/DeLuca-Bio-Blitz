## Natural history notes

As the name suggests, Black Vultures (Coragyps atratus) are completely black except for the white tips on the underside of their wings. Their head additionally lacks feathers. Their diet is almost exclusively carrion and they will find it by soaring high in the sky. They often are found in groups at carcasses. Black Vultures will nest in dark areas such as caves, hollow trees, or even abandoned buildings. They will stay with their single mate for many years and reuse successful nesting sites.
