## Natural history notes

The Roundleaf Bluet (Houstonia procumbens) is a tiny, low-growing wildflower of the southeastern United States, often carpeting sandy soils, lawns, and open woodlands. It produces small white flowers with yellow centers in early spring, sometimes forming dense mats that brighten the ground. Its rounded leaves form tight rosettes close to the soil, helping it tolerate dry, open habitats. Though delicate in appearance, it plays a role in supporting early-season pollinators like bees and flies.
