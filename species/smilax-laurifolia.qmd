## Natural history notes

Saw greenbrier is a rampant vine from thickened and knotty rhizome with stems and branches are four-ridge. Native Americans historically used parts of this plant: its large rhizome was cooked or ground for food, and roots were sometimes used medicinally. The Acadian French name for all the members of the genus Smilax is "cantaque". This name comes from the Choctaw name for greenbriar (Holmes 1990).
