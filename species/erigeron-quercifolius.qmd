## Natural history notes

The Oakleaf Fleabane (Erigeron quercifolius) is a native wildflower of the southeastern United States, commonly found in moist meadows, ditches, and open woodlands. It produces delicate white to pinkish daisy-like flowers with yellow centers that bloom through spring and summer. Its lobed, oak-shaped leaves give the plant its name. By providing nectar for bees and butterflies, it plays a valuable role in supporting pollinators across a variety of wetland and upland habitats.
