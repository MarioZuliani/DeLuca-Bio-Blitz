## Natural history notes

The Cutleaf Evening Primrose (Oenothera laciniata) is a low, sprawling biennial or short-lived perennial in the evening primrose family (Onagraceae), native to eastern North America but now introduced in other regions worldwide. Its name Oenothera comes from Greek, often interpreted as “wine scent,” because some species’ roots were thought to smell like wine. Like many evening primroses, the flowers open in the evening or at dusk, catering to nocturnal pollinators like sphinx moths.
