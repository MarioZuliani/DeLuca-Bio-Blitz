## Natural history notes

The Musky Mint (Hyptis alata) is a fragrant, mint-family wildflower native to wetlands, marsh edges, and moist meadows of the southeastern United States. It produces spikes of pale lavender flowers that bloom from summer into fall, attracting bees, butterflies, and other pollinators. The plantâ€™s square stems and aromatic leaves give off a musky scent when crushed. By thriving in damp soils, it contributes to the diversity and productivity of wetland plant communities.
