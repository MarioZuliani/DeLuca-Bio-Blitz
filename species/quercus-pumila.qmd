## Natural history notes

The Running Oak (Quercus pumila) is a low, spreading oak native to the southeastern United States. Unlike most oaks, it grows as a prostrate or low, shrubby plant (usually under 1 m tall) that spreads by underground rhizomes, forming colonies. Acorns are small, borne singly or in pairs, and serve as food for wildlife including birds and small mammals. It is well adapted to drought, nutrient-poor sandy soils, and fire-maintained ecosystems.
