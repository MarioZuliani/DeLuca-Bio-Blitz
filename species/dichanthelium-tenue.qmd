The White-edged Witchgrass (Dichanthelium tenue) is a perennial member of the grass family. It grows in moist to dry, sandy woods, savannahs, and disturbed sites. Its fine texture and subtle inflorescences make it an inconspicuous but ecologically important component of native groundcover. The genus name Dichanthelium means “twice-flowering,” referring to its dual blooming strategy.
