## Natural history notes

Climbing Dayflower (Commelina diffusa) is a creeping, mat-forming annual or short-lived perennial herb. It produces distinctive blue flowers with two large upper petals and one small, inconspicuous lower petal, usually opening in the morning and fading by afternoon. Its mucilaginous stems and leaves have been used in folk medicine in Asia and the Pacific for fevers, sore throats, and skin ailments. In some regions it is used as a fodder plant for livestock, though in others it is considered a noxious weed.
