## Natural history notes

Ballmoss (Tillandsia recurvata) is a small, gray-green epiphyte in the bromeliad family, commonly found attached to tree branches, power lines, and fences across the southeastern United States. Despite appearances, it is not parasiticâ€”it gathers moisture and nutrients from the air through its specialized leaves. It forms dense, spherical clumps that provide shelter for insects and small spiders. Ballmoss thrives in humid environments and is an important part of the natural epiphyte community in subtropical forests.
