## Natural history notes

Cuban bulrush (Cyperus blepharoleptos) is an invasive sedge found throughout Florida and parts of the southeastern United States. Native to Central and South America, this species forms floating mats that can dominate an area, outcompeting other native species. As a result, this plant is often managed for to prevent it from taking over large areas and reducing local biodiversity. This plant is now found in over half of Floridaâ€™s waterbodies.
