## Natural history notes

The Savannah False Pimpernel (Lindernia grandiflora) is a creeping wetland plant native to the southeastern United States, often found along pond margins, ditches, and wet meadows. It produces small, violet to blue, two-lipped flowers that bloom through much of the growing season. Its spreading stems root easily at the nodes, forming mats that help stabilize muddy soils. This delicate species adds color to shallow wetlands while providing nectar for small pollinators.
