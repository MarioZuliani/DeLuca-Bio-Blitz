## Natural history notes

Swamp sawgrass (Cladium mariscus) is a native sedge commonly found in freshwater and brackish-water systems throughout the southeastern United States. This wetland staple can be easily identified by its sharp serrations (“teeth”) on the undersides of the leaves, which can cut skin. This plant is especially pervasive in the Florida Everglades and is the grass referenced when describing the Everglades as a “River of Grass.” The species recently went through changes to its scientific name, so the species seen at DeLuca could potentially be Cladium jamaicense, which used to be a subspecies of Cladium mariscus.
