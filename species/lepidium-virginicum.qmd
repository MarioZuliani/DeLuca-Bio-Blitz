## Natural history notes

Virginia Pepperweed (Lepidium virginicum) is a common annual plant found in fields, roadsides, and disturbed soils throughout much of North America. It produces small white flowers and flat, circular seedpods that resemble tiny coins, earning it the nickname “poor man’s pepper.” Both its leaves and seeds have a sharp, peppery taste and have been used as a seasoning in folk traditions. Its flowers attract small pollinators, while its seeds are eaten by birds and other wildlife.
