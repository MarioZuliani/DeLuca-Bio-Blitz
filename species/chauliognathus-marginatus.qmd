## Natural history notes

Margined Leatherwing Beetles (Chauliognathus marginatus) are characterized from their distinctive appearance. They typically have an orange outline around its black body and wings. However, coloration can vary. Margined Leatherwing Beetles get their name from their "leather-like" wings as they are soft rather than hard. Adults often feed on pollen and nectar. While both the adult and larval stages are known to be predatory.
