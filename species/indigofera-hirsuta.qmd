## Natural history notes

The Hairy Indigo (Indigofera hirsuta) is a hairy herb or small subshrub in the legume family (Fabaceae) that can grow erect to about 1 m tall, often from a deep central root or rhizome. It is native to the Old World tropics (Africa, Asia, Australia) but now is naturalized or introduced in many tropical and subtropical regions globally, including parts of the southeastern U.S. It exhibits a floral-tripping or “explosive” pollination mechanism typical of many Indigofera species: if a pollinator touches the base of the banner petal, the petals can collapse and cause rapid release (“puff”) of pollen from the anthers. In some contexts I. hirsuta is considered a weed or invasive — in Florida for example it is non-native and shows up in disturbed areas.
