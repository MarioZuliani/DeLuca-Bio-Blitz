## Natural history notes

The Red Maple (Acer rubrum) is one of the most widespread and adaptable trees in eastern North America, thriving in wetlands, forests, and urban areas alike. It is named for its brilliant red featuresâ€”buds in spring, flowers before leaf-out, and vibrant fall foliage. Its winged seeds, called samaras, are a key food source for squirrels, birds, and other wildlife. Because of its fast growth and tolerance for many soils, it is also a popular shade and ornamental tree.
