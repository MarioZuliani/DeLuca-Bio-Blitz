## Natural history notes

Downy Woodpeckers (Dryobates pubescens) are small, typical looking woodpeckers. They are checkered black and white on their wings, with black on top of their head and a stripe by their eyes. They have a white stripe across their back and their entire stomach is white. Males have a small red patch on the back of their head. Downy Woodpeckers typically eat insects that live inside tree bark, however they will also eat berries and seeds. They will nest in dead trees as excavating is easier and only takes both the male and female 1 to 3 weeks to complete.
