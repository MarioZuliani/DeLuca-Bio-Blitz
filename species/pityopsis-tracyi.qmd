## Natural history notes

Tracyâ€™s Silkgrass (Pityopsis tracyi) is a perennial wildflower native to the sandy soils and pine flatwoods of the southeastern United States. It produces bright yellow, daisy-like flowers in late summer and fall that provide nectar for bees and butterflies. Its narrow, silvery leaves are covered in fine hairs that give the plant a silky sheen and help it conserve moisture. Like other silkgrasses, it is well adapted to fire-prone habitats, contributing to the resilience of longleaf pine ecosystems.
