## Natural history notes

Vanillaleaf (Carphephorus odoratissimus) is a perennial wildflower recognized for its clusters of small purple flowers. It can be found in habitats such as hydric pine flatwoods, moist sandhills, and bogs, and typically blooms from late summer into fall. The plantâ€™s common name comes from the sweet, vanilla-like fragrance released when its dried leaves are crushed. Vanillaleaf is widespread across Florida, and at DeLuca the subspecies present is the Pineland Purple (Carphephorus odoratissimus var. subtropicanus).
