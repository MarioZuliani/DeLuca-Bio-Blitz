## Natural history notes

The Oriental False Hawksbeard (Youngia japonica) is an annual that produces yellow flowers. It typically grows in disturbed sites, lawns, gardens, roadsides, and cracks in pavement, forming basal rosettes of lobed leaves before sending up slender flowering stems up to 30–60 cm tall. Its epithet japonica means “of Japan,” where the species was first described scientifically. This species has spread rapidly in southeastern region, and is now moving into minimally-disturbed natural areas.
