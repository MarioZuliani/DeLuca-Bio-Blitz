## Natural history notes

The Common Water Hyacinth (Pontederia crassipes) is an aquatic plant native to the Amazon River in Brazil. This free-floating freshwater plant prefers temperatures above 50°F, and can reproduce either sexually or by cloning itself. It grows quickly and often forms mats that sit in the surface layer of the water. It was introduced to New Orleans in 1884, and has since spread throughout the southeastern United States, with year-round growth in South Florida. Because of its prolific growth and tendency to form mats, Common Water Hyacinth can block waterways and reduce oxygen levels in the water, which can be dangerous to native aquatic plants and animals. This plant is considered invasive in Florida, and many methods have been used to reduce its impact, such as biocontrol and chemical treatments.
