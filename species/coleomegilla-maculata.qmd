## Natural history notes

The spotted pink lady beetle (Coleomegilla maculata) is a native beetle in the ladybug (Coccinellidae) family. It can be anywhere from pink to red in color. These beetles, like most ladybugs, prey on aphids, making it a popular species for biological control for crops like wheat, soybeans, and potatoes. Pollen also makes up a significant portion of this animalâ€™s diet, which is unusual for ladybugs.
