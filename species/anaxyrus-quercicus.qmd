## Natural history notes

The Oak Toad (Anaxyrus quercicus) is the smallest toad in North America, rarely exceeding an inch in length. It inhabits sandy pine forests and oak woodlands of the southeastern United States, where it spends much of its time buried in loose soil. Its high-pitched, birdlike trill can be heard after heavy rains when males gather at temporary ponds to breed. Despite its tiny size, it plays an important role in controlling insect populations.
