## Natural history notes

The Resurrection Fern (Pleopeltis michauxiana) is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without taking nutrients from them. It can be found in the Southeastern United States, the Midwest United States, Mexico, and Guatemala. Although it is known to grow on trees, it grows on a variety of terrestrial substrates, including rocks and mossy banks. It prefers habitats that are moist and shaded. This plant gets its name from its ability to survive desiccation by using its scaly surface to slow down dehydration. It shrivels up and turns brown in the process, but quickly plumps up and regains its green color when hydrated, resembling a resurrection!
