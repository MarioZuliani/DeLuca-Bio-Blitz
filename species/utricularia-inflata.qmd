## Natural history notes

The Swollen Bladderwort (Utricularia inflata) was first described by Thomas Walter in 1788. Although it is native in many U.S. states, it is also known to be introduced (and potentially invasive) in regions beyond its native range (e.g. New York, Massachusetts, Washington), where it can form dense mats that suppress native aquatic plants, alter sediment chemistry, and reduce habitat quality. Because its traps operate on a suction mechanism (the plant pumps water out of the bladder to create negative pressure, then when a prey touches trigger hairs, the door “buckles” open and sucks in water and the prey), it is part of the fascinating mechanical world of bladderwort trapping.
