## Natural history notes

The Hemlock Witchgrass (Dichanthelium portoricense) ia a perennial grass inhabits sandy woods, low pinelands, savannas, coastal sand dunes, and moist habitats. The genus name Dichanthelium means “twice flowering”, referring to the dual growth / flowering phases that many species in this genus show. In Florida, it occurs in numerous conservation areas and is considered native and secure in South Florida. It is a highly variable species with numerous intergrading forms, some possibly resulting from hybridization with other widespread species in the same region, such as D. sphaerocarpon and D. commutatum.
