The short-winged green grasshopper (Dichromorpha viridis) is a grasshopper found in areas of the eastern United States and Canada. In Florida, this is one of the most common species of grasshopper, often found in grasses and lawns. However, there are conservation concerns for this species in other areas, including Wisconsin and Ontario. This species is also typically sexually dimorphic; the males are usually green, and the females are usually brown.
