## Natural history notes

Also called Wrightâ€™s nutrush, lakeshore nutrush (Scleria lacustris) is an invasive sedge found mostly in central and south Florida wetlands. This plant is classified by the Florida Invasive Species Council as a Category I invasive exotic, meaning that it has been shown to alter native plant communities. As such, this species is often managed for to prevent it from competing with other native plants. Its seeds can be spread easily via airboats, and saturated conditions can be used to stop their seeds from sprouting.
