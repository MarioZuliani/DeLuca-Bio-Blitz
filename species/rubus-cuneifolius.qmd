## Natural history notes

The Sand Blackberry (Rubus cuneifolius) is a native bramble of the southeastern United States, thriving in sandy soils, pine flatwoods, and open fields. It produces arching, thorny canes and sweet black fruits that are eaten by people, birds, and mammals alike. Its flowers provide nectar for bees and butterflies, while the dense thickets offer shelter for small animals. As both a food source and habitat plant, it plays a valuable role in supporting wildlife in dry, open ecosystems.
