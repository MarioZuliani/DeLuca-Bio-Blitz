## Natural history notes

Eastern Lubber Grasshoppers (Romalea microptera) are characterized by their distinct coloring as adults. However, this coloring can differ from a yellow or orange color to black. Nymphs differ in appearance from adults as they are almost completely black with a yellow, orange, or red stripe down their back. Nymphs continuously change in appearance depending on which stage of life they are in as there are typically 5 or 6 instars that occur. Natural predators are few as they will produce toxic secretions. However, Loggerhead Shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus) will leave them to degrade for 1-2 days after capturing. They additionally have a wide range of host plants including at least 100 different species.
