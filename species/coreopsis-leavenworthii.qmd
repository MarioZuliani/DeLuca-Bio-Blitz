## Natural history notes

Leavenworthâ€™s Tickseed (Coreopsis leavenworthii) is a cheerful wildflower native to the wetlands and flatwoods of the southeastern United States, particularly Florida. It produces bright yellow, daisy-like blooms with notched petals that appear nearly year-round in warm climates. The flowers attract bees, butterflies, and other pollinators, making it a favorite in native plant gardens. Its adaptability to both wet and dry soils allows it to thrive in a wide range of habitats.
