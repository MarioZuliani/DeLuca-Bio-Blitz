## Natural history notes

The Gray Catbird (Dumetella carolinensis) is a songbird found in thickets, shrubs, and forest edges across much of North America. It is best known for its catlike “mew” call and its ability to mimic the songs of other birds within its long, varied repertoire. Catbirds primarily eat insects and berries, playing an important role in seed dispersal. Unlike many mimics, they often sing from concealed perches, adding to their elusive reputation.
