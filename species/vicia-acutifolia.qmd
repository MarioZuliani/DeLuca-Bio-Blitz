## Natural history notes

The Fourleaf Vetch (Vicia acutifolia) is a slender, climbing or trailing annual legume native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open woods, roadsides, and fields, using tendrils at the tips of its compound leaves to climb on surrounding vegetation. Its leaves usually have 4â€“8 narrow leaflets, and the plant produces small purple to violet pea-like flowers, often singly or in pairs. Its genus name Vicia is Latin for vetch, a group of climbing legumes long recognized in agriculture and wild flora.
