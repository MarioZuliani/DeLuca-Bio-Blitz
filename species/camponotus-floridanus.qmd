## Natural history notes

Florida Carpenter Ants (Camponotus floridanus) are characterized by their brown to orange colored thorax & head and black gaster. Their thorax is evenly convex and have abundant body hairs that are long and golden. Their antennae have 12-segements without a club. Florida Carpenter ants lack a stinger, but workers may bite and spray formic acid. They will forage at night preferring something sweet such as nectars from aphids, scales, and mealybugs.
