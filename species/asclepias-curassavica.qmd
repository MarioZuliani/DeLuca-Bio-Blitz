## Natural history notes

The tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica) is a commonly grown ornamental plant in Florida and serves as a host plant for monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus). However, because it is non-native to Florida, it is not considered as beneficial for monarchs as native milkweed species, and some sources warn against planting it. Although tropical milkweed has escaped cultivation and established in some natural areas, it is classified as a non-native rather than an invasive species.
