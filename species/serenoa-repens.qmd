## Natural history notes

Saw Palmetto (Serona repens) is an evergreen palm named after American botanist Sereno Watson. The petiole, or leaf stem, famously has spiky teeth giving this plant it's namesake, Saw Palmetto. The Saw Palmetto serves as the host plant for the Monk Skipper and Palmetto Skipper butterflies, and the berries are a food source for over 100 different animals in Florida.
