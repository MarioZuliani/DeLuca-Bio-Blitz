## Natural history notes

Elliottâ€™s Milkpea (Galactia elliottii) is a trailing legume native to the sandy pinelands and scrub habitats of the southeastern United States. It produces clusters of small pink to purplish flowers that attract bees and butterflies throughout the summer. Like other legumes, it enriches the soil by fixing atmospheric nitrogen through its root nodules. Its twining stems and dense foliage also provide cover for small animals and insects in open, fire-maintained ecosystems.
