## Natural history notes

The Grass-leaved Arrowhead (Sagittaria graminea) is an aquatic plant found in shallow ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams across eastern North America. Unlike many other arrowheads, its leaves are long and grasslike, rising above the waterâ€™s surface. It produces delicate white flowers with three petals, which provide nectar for pollinators such as bees and flies. Its submerged parts offer shelter for aquatic invertebrates and small fish, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems.
