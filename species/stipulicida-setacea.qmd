## Natural history notes

The Wire-plant (Stipulicida setacea) is a tiny, wiry-stemmed herb native to the sandy soils of the southeastern United States. It grows in dry pinelands and scrub habitats, often in nutrient-poor, open areas. Its delicate white flowers appear close to the ground and are easily overlooked due to the plantâ€™s fine, threadlike form. Despite its small size, it contributes to the biodiversity of fire-adapted sandhill and scrub ecosystems.
