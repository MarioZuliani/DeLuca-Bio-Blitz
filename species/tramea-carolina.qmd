## Natural history notes

Carolina Saddlebags (Tramea carolina) are large dragonflies known for their bright red body and reddish-brown patches on their wings. Their face is a violet color that is more apparent in males than females. Carolina Saddlebags typically feed on mosquitoes (both adults and larval stages depending on their own stage). As adults, they will feed while flying. They are able to reach speeds of up to 17 mph and primarily fly during the day.
