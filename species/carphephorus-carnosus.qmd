## Natural history notes

The Pineland Chaffhead (Carphephorus carnosus) is a rare wildflower of the Florida panhandle, found in sandy pinelands and open flatwoods. It produces clusters of small, purple flower heads in late summer, which are highly attractive to butterflies and other pollinators. This species is closely tied to fire-maintained habitats, where periodic burns keep the open conditions it needs to thrive. Because of its limited range, it is considered a species of conservation concern.
