Mischievous Bird Grasshoppers (Schistocerca damnifica) have a brown coloration, thick antennae, and distinct pronotal ridge. Ocassionally, a lighter mid-dorsal stripe is present on the head and pronotum. They may also have irregular darker spotting on their sides. Females are typically larger than males reaching lengths of 37-47 mm and 25-35 mm, respectively. Mischievous Bird Grasshoppers can also be found year round and will commonly overwinter as an adult in the South.
