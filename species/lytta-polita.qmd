## Natural history notes

Bronze Blister Beetles (Lytta polita) are soft-bodied, long-legged beetles that range from 3/4 and 2 cm long. Adults are active between December and June. They are often found near lights or on plants during the day. Bronze Blister Beetles get their name from their bronze coloration and their hemolymph produces blistering when it comes it contact with our skin. This blistering action is caused by the presence of cantharidin, only found elsewhere in the family Oedemeridae, which used to be used in human and veterinary medicine as a vesicant or irritant.
