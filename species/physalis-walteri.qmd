## Natural history notes

The dune groundcherry (Physalis walteri) is a native plant found in the southeastern United States. A member of the nightshade (Solanaceae) family, this plant produces a fruit that, when ripe, is said to be edible, but it can be toxic if eaten before that. It likes drier conditions with sandy or rocky soils. This plant was named after Thomas Walter, the first botanist in North America to publish a book on plants using the two-part scientific naming system.
