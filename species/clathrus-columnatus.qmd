## Natural history notes

The column stinkhorn (Clathrus columnatus) gets its name from the potent odor it emits, which attracts insects that then disperse its spores across the landscape. In Florida, this mushroom is most commonly found in the winter and early spring following wet weather. Like other fungi, the column stinkhorn helps decompose organic matter and contributes to nutrient recycling.
