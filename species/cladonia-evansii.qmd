## Natural history notes

Evansâ€™ Deer Moss (Cladonia evansii) is a pale, branching lichen that covers sandy soils and pine flatwoods in the southeastern United States. Despite its name, it is not a true moss but a lichen, formed from a partnership between fungus and algae. It plays an important ecological role by helping retain moisture, prevent soil erosion, and provide forage for deer and other wildlife. Its delicate, gray-green mats are also a distinctive feature of healthy, undisturbed pine ecosystems.
