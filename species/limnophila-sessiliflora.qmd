## Natural history notes

Sessile Marshweed (Limnophila sessiliflora) is an aquatic plant native to Asia but now naturalized in parts of the southeastern United States. It has finely divided, feathery underwater leaves and whorls of broader leaves at the waterâ€™s surface, making it popular in aquariums. In the wild, it grows rapidly in ponds, ditches, and wetlands, where it can form dense mats. While it provides shelter for fish and invertebrates, it may also compete with native aquatic plants when it spreads aggressively.
