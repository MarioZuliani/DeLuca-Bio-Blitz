## Natural history notes

The Slash Pine (Pinus elliottii) is a tall, fast-growing pine native to the southeastern United States, especially common in flatwoods, wetlands, and coastal plains. It has long, glossy needles and produces large cones that provide food for squirrels and birds. Well adapted to fire, it regenerates quickly in burned areas and forms part of the iconic longleafâ€“slash pine ecosystem. Its strong, resin-rich wood has long been valued for lumber, pulp, and turpentine production.
