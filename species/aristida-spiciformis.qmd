## Natural history notes

The Bottlebrush Threeawn (Aristida spiciformis) is a native grass of the southeastern United States, typically growing in dry, sandy soils and open pine habitats. It gets its name from its distinctive seed heads, which resemble tiny bottlebrushes with their long, bristly awns. This hardy grass helps stabilize soil and provides cover for insects and small wildlife. Adapted to fire-maintained ecosystems, it flourishes in the open conditions created by periodic burns.
