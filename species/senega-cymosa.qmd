## Natural history notes

The Tall Pinebarren Milkwort (Senega cymosa) is a slender wildflower native to the sandy pine flatwoods and savannas of the southeastern United States. It produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers arranged in elegant spikes that bloom in summer. Well adapted to fire-maintained habitats, it flourishes in open, sunny conditions with nutrient-poor soils. Its blooms attract native bees and butterflies, adding both beauty and ecological value to pine barren landscapes.
