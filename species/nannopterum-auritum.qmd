## Natural history notes

The Double-crested Cormorant (Nannopterum auritum) is a widespread waterbird of North America, often seen diving for fish in lakes, rivers, and coastal waters. Unlike many aquatic birds, its feathers get wet, which helps it dive efficiently but requires it to perch with wings outstretched to dry. It nests in colonies, often in trees or on islands, where its guano can heavily impact local vegetation. Once persecuted as a competitor to fisheries, the species has rebounded strongly and is now a familiar sight across much of its range.
